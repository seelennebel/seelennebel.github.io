I chose to work in the IT industry to utilize and expand technologies 
toward new horizons of human development. I believe that by working as a software developer in my future company I can use frontline technologies to squeeze all potential of IT technologies and handle it to the business. I am interested in working on deep learning, web development, and robotics projects.
